Increasingly, I can't shake the feeling that there is widespread apathy toward our culture and our historical artifacts — books, letters, art, music, cinema, and so on. And the more I speak to people who actually work on these things, the more ashamed I feel that I just free-ride on all the hard work others do to preserve historical and cultural material in the public domain. Paper Lanterns is simply my small effort to do something. In the grand scheme of things, it's more or less irrelevant; what I'm doing isn't a big deal. But I'd rather do even a little than be useless and feel like shit.
