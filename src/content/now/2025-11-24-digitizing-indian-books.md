I've been playing around with Gemini to extract text from old historical books in the public domain, and it's crazy that it can now extract clean, neatly formatted text with citations in a single shot. It's making me think about starting a simple project to digitize historic Indian books — something modest, similar in spirit to Standard Books or Gutenberg, though obviously not on that scale. I don't have the resources. I'm just using a $20 Gemini subscription, but maybe I can start sharing these texts and see if I can find help, see if others want to get involved.
