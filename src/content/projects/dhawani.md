Dhawani.ink is my personal microblog where I share quick thoughts, observations, and notes that don't quite fit into long-form essays.

It's a space for thinking out loud, capturing fleeting ideas, and sharing snippets of what I'm learning, reading, or pondering. Think of it as my digital garden for shorter, more spontaneous writing.

The name "dhawani" (ध्वनि) means "sound" or "echo" in Sanskrit—a fitting metaphor for these small reverberations of thought.
